# Flappy Bird Clone

A verty basic Flappy Bird Clone created with Godot 3.2 using [Tappy Plane assets by Kenney](www.kenney.nl)

## Why?

I created this to get back into the Godot game engine and become more familiar with the tools.

## What does it demonstrate?

- Use of a scrolling background
- Basic gameplay loop
- Spawning obstacles
- Using Timers and signals
